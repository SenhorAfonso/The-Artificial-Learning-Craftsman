# Greetings, craftsman!
Hello everyone. Hope you doing well.    
If you are here you probably love artificial intelligence as much as i do, and you must have had a really bad time trying to find some quality materials about the theme.  
There are so many courses, articles, books, videos, etc. about artificial intelligence that find the best ones among they are kinda hard. Furthermore, sometimes we also need to read other person notes to build our own knowledge over their line of reasoning about the subject or even to see things by another angle and improve your own learning process.

This repository is my attempt to make things easier for anyone who dares to venture in the Artificial Intelligence Craftsmanship. So let me explain what are my intentions here.

## learning path

The learning path is a selection of courses, articles, videos and anything else of different sources.  
My goal here is to make a path starting in the very basics and foundamental stuff, like Python programming, math and data science libraries; and head up to the most advanced topics, like deep leaning, computer vision and so on. I will try my best to place this study materials in the best order possible, but feel free to take it the way you fell more confortable.

## notebooks

I really like to share my notes and notebooks with anyone who is interessed. I think thats is a good way to disseminate knowledge and help people grown faster. Also, the felling that i have someone reading what i am writing pushes me to write and explain it better, as if i were a professor responsible to teach and make you make be aproved in the final test. So i think we have a win-win situation here.

All the notes will be in the GitHub wiki. Think about the wiki as the "official" way of getting into my notes, but i will also share my Obsidian vault with you, in case you want to clone them and have an way to study offline, up to you. The vault will be in the `obsidian-vault` foulder.

That being said, let start studying!
